-- 1. First, let's get the base join structure
SELECT * FROM cost_report c
JOIN revenue_report r ON c.campaign_id = r.campaign_id;

-- 2. Add date formatting
SELECT DATE_FORMAT(c.data_date, '%Y/%m/%d') as date
FROM cost_report c
JOIN revenue_report r ON c.campaign_id = r.campaign_id;

-- 3. Add campaign identification
SELECT 
    DATE_FORMAT(c.data_date, '%Y/%m/%d') as date,
    c.campaign_id,
    c.campaign_name
FROM cost_report c
JOIN revenue_report r ON c.campaign_id = r.campaign_id;

-- 4. Add revenue and cost metrics
SELECT 
    DATE_FORMAT(c.data_date, '%Y/%m/%d') as date,
    c.campaign_id,
    c.campaign_name,
    r.revenue as total_revenue,
    c.cost as total_cost
FROM cost_report c
JOIN revenue_report r ON c.campaign_id = r.campaign_id;

-- 5. Add calculated fields
SELECT 
    DATE_FORMAT(c.data_date, '%Y/%m/%d') as date,
    c.campaign_id,
    c.campaign_name,
    r.revenue as total_revenue,
    c.cost as total_cost,
    (r.revenue - c.cost) as total_profit,
    c.clicks as total_clicks
FROM cost_report c
JOIN revenue_report r ON c.campaign_id = r.campaign_id;

-- 6. Add performance metrics
SELECT 
    DATE_FORMAT(c.data_date, '%Y/%m/%d') as date,
    c.campaign_id,
    c.campaign_name,
    r.revenue as total_revenue,
    c.cost as total_cost,
    (r.revenue - c.cost) as total_profit,
    c.clicks as total_clicks,
    (r.revenue / c.cost) as total_roi,
    (c.cost / c.clicks) as avg_cpc
FROM cost_report c
JOIN revenue_report r ON c.campaign_id = r.campaign_id;

-- 7. Final complete query with all metrics
SELECT 
    DATE_FORMAT(c.data_date, '%Y/%m/%d') as date,
    c.campaign_id,
    c.campaign_name,
    r.revenue as total_revenue,
    c.cost as total_cost,
    (r.revenue - c.cost) as total_profit,
    c.clicks as total_clicks,
    (r.revenue / c.cost) as total_roi,
    (c.cost / c.clicks) as avg_cpc,
    (r.revenue / 24) as hourly_avg_revenue,
    CASE 
        WHEN (r.revenue - c.cost) > 0 THEN 24 
        ELSE 0 
    END as positive_profit_hours
FROM cost_report c
JOIN revenue_report r ON c.campaign_id = r.campaign_id;
